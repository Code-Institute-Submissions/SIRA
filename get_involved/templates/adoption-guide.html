                    <p>Spain's rescue dogs are feral animals found in diffrent parts of Spain. They have lived either on the streets or in a shelter, most of their lives, which creates some unique personality an bahavioral traits. While people who have adopted these dogs are having sucess with keeping them in ther now "domesticated" home settings, there are many factors to consider before maling a final decision.</p><br>
                    <p>First and foremost, most of these street dogs are not being specifically bred to be of any use to humans. They are the intended consequences of families abandoning there pets on the streets, which has lead to generations of feral dogs breeding on the streets. While many of the dogs may have trace remnants of domestic lines in their blood, they are predisposed, by nature, to wary of strangers, independent oof humans, trust only their own pack mates, and <strong>SURVIVE!</strong></p>

                    <h3 class="title is-size-4 has-text-link">Life with a "Forgotten Pet"</h3>
                    <p>The dog that you are about to adopt of foster is not a "domesticated" dogs, which means that you are most likely going to face some challenges. You are obligates to provide your new dog with not only food, shelter and affection, but patience, consistency, and leadership 24/7 for the remainder of its life or for as long as the dog is in your care.</p><br>
                    <p>Rescue dogs have been conditioned by their enviroment(s) to be watchful, fearful, cautions, and to not to let their guard down because either a human could hurt them, or another dog could attack them. As a result, many rescue dogs. first arrive to their new homes showing characteristics of anxiety or fear - wanting to hide in a small room, not accepting treats, and being lerry to strangers. These are telltale signs of a lack of confidence, which can be
                        attribited to their uncertain lives, whether on the street or in a shelter. <strong>Please note: With proper training and patience, dogs with these behaviors have been successful in adjusting to life as a normal, somesticated dog. But be advised, <italic>this is not a quick process. It can take weeks to several months, even a year, to fully adjust,</italic>and there is no way to know exactly, bacuse each dog, like humans, processes their experiences differently.</strong></p><br>
                    <p>Also take note that most rescues don't respond well to coercive tactics and will require much more patience, consistency and creative training techniques thank the average dog.</p><br>
                    <p>You must be willing to make changes to your daily schedule and be prepared to hire a professional to guide you through the steps of introducing you rescue dog to its new enviroment and domesticated life. Most people adopting a rescue dog have had some experience with owing and even training dogs beforehand. <strong>But please note: that even some of the most seasoned dog-trainers have found it challenging, not impossible, but challenging to work through some of the behavioral issues presented by our rescue dogs. </strong>Most of the issues are very commonplace and are exhibited in the homes of domestic dogs as well; however rescue dogs have a tendency to be leery of humans and take a while to adjust to domesticated life.</p>

                    <h3 class="title is-size-4 has-text-link">Where your dogs come from</h3>
                    <p>Forgotten pets from Spain come from a variety of living situations:</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">From streets to shelter: </strong> Most of the dogs we support in rescuing were once living on the streets, but hace since been rescued and are living in a shelter. These dogs have lived in small confined spaces, such as shelter kennels, and are used to that type of setting. It is not uncommon for these to show a desire to fins a small, quiet place to retreat to once in a new home. They will most likely be leery of strangers, and will need a great deal of help building their confidence.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">From street to home: </strong>Some of our rescues have kept smaller dogs inside of their home. These dogs are the least scared of people, as they have insteraction in a home setting. They tend to be inside most of the day if the rescuer goes to their job - that being said, these dogs have been the ones that haven't come to their forever homes "house broken" - they've been used to pottying inside, anywhere. Once rehomed, owners have said that these dogs have been relatively easy to train, as long ther are given time and patience.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Straight from the streets: </strong>Forgotten dogs who have either been in shelters for only a short time, or came directly from the streets, can become quite destructive if not given proper exercise on a daily basis, especially in the beginning. Very few dogs are adopted or fostered directly from the streets - most of them have either been in a shelter or home enviroment. In the beginning these rescues can be extremely destruvtive, don't want to be inside at all, and never laid on any dog beds. With lots of time and patience these dogs can be completely transformed.</p>

                <div class="card-content">
                    <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-link">How your rescue might act</h3>
                    <p>The following is a brief list of the most common behavior issues that are associated with rescuing a dog. This is not an exhaustive list, and your dog may exhibit some, all, or additional behaviors not described in this list.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Cats: </strong>Most rescue dogs don't have interaction with cats. We the dogs are in the shelter we try to let them have some interaction with cats, depending on there tolerance. Altough we cannot give any guarentee of how all dogs will react to cats in a domestic environment, some have been living inside our rescuer's home with cats, and get along fine. Cat tolerance can only be determined with relation to a specific sog.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Toys: </strong>Many rescue dogs display a desinterest in toys upon first arriving to their new home. This most likely because they have no idea what they are or what to do with them! Keep in mind, these dogs have no idea what it means to be a normal dog. They're born on the streets... forced to survive on their own, avoid being killed/abused/poisoned, also while trying to figure out what to eat and how to find it. Toys are considered "resources", and they've truly never had their own - food, space, and attention have all been shortages, so having all of these things all of a sudden confuses them, as they don't quite know how to cope with being a "normal" dog.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Digging: </strong>Rescue dogs often dig "cooling dens" large enough for them to crawl into. They have also dug under and jumped over fences when left unattended, and have the desire to roam.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Destructive behavior: </strong>Chewing and sometimes even ingesting random objects, "shredding" - papers, blankets, dog beds, etc.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Escaping: </strong>Some dogs have learned how to open doors and fences. Some have gone through screens as well. This is due to their street-dog nature, where they are used to roaming free.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Barking: </strong>A tendency to jump up and bark at passers-by, other dogs, bikes, etc. or barks constantly to get what it wants or when left alone.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Hyper-reactivity or Hyper-sensitivity: </strong>Becomes aggressive or fearful around loud noises, fireworks, thunder, airplanes, etc.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Over-protective: </strong>Most rescue dogs usually have the tendency to be very affectionate toward their human pack, and have also seemed to sccept "new pack members" fairy readily. However, if not given proper training, socialization, and behavior modification early on, like any dog, they may become overprotective and show signs of aggression towards visitors - even childeren.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Food aggression: </strong>Many dogs didn't have ample and adequate access to food and water. They may show signs of aggression towards humans and other animals while eating or if they have a bone.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="title is-size-4 has-text-link">Preparing for your pet</h3>
                    <p>A veterinarian examines every dog to be cleared for travel from Spain. This information is recorded in the dog's passport, as well as on a health certificate (if required for transportation).</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Behavior - </strong>Your dog will be extremely tired so treat them like they have had surgery and let them rest a lot. Do not over stimulate; they will most likely be cranky, scared, etc. They will be on alert for friend or foe, a survival tactic needed in Spain (especially the older animals)</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Appearance - </strong>Please keep in mind, although your dog was approved to leave Bosnia and deemed healthy enough to enter a new country, the dog may show signs of malnutrition, have matted hair, and even have an odor. Dogs are not bathed prior to departure, keep in mind that after months of being in a shelter or on the street, it will take multiple baths to get rid of the "shelter smell". Also because of poor diet, dogs may have dry skin, scabs, or other visible skin issue. <strong>Please note: Any significant skin issues, such as Demodex, are disclosed during initial stages of the adoption process.</strong></p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Arrival procedure - </strong>Your dog's destination country will determin the arrival procedures. If the dog is going to another European country, the dog is transported in accordance with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/traces_en">TRACES</a> Please keep in mind, these animals are evaluated at each border crossing during transportation for illness or injury before being cleared to enter
                        each country.</p><br>

                    <h3 class="title is-size-4 has-text-link">The first few days</h3>
                    <p>You may find your dog is still very skittish or scared, even a few days after being with you. Yhis is completely normal. Remember, this dog has just been completely uprooted from everything he/she knows. You will have to establish trust with them by giving them space, patience, and love. The following guidlines may help to acclimate rescues to new homes, but are not guarentee of successful acclimation.</p><br>
                    <p><strong class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-weight-bold">Feeding: </strong>

                                <li>Give bland food with a little dry to slowly get them acclimated to the food. A recommended food is 24% protein and grain free. Higher protein in large breeds can stimulate growth too fast that can lead to joint and hip problems (hip dysplasia and long bone disease).</li>
                                <li>If diarrhea occurs add the new food slower</li>
                                <li>Rice, ground turkey and chicken, yogurt, baby food chicken, turkey or beef are usually well tolerated.</li>
                                <li>Forti flora is a good product that has probiotics found to help with the transition in food and water</li>
                                <li>If diarrhea or lethargic occur, take to vet immediately!!</li>
                                <li>Vitamin C and B complex are highly suggested to aid their immune system</li>

                                <li>Dogs will have been dewormed and given flea-tick treatment before departing Spain.</li>
                                <li>Have your vet administer a new rabies shot/booster -- that will provide a rabies tag needed to register the dog in your county. Your country / local requirements may require other vaccines. Provide your pet’s passport to your vet, and he/she can make determination as to what other vaccines are needed. This list is not all-inclusive, so please consult your vet for any additional requirements.</li>

                                <li>Do not introduce the new dog to existing dogs right away. Keep the new dog separate in a garage or bathroom with food and water and a bed for a day or two. Gradually introduce household pets to the new dog.</li>
                                <li>If you have a dog already, make sure your original dog gets a lot of food and praise. Do not them eat in the same area or get into a fight. It is always best to introduce them in a park near your home first.</li>
