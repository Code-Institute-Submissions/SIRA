      <p>Why are there so many stray dogs in Spain?</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>These dogs are the intended consequence of owners abandoning their pets on the side of the road. Pets that aren't castrated or sterilize breed in uncontrolable manner, thus creating more stray dogs.</p>

       <p>Spanish stray dogs come in any shape, size, color, or type "pawsible!". They are primarily a mix of common breeds, such as German Sheperds, Hounds, Retrievers and Labradors. But we've also rescued dogs the size of a small Poodle, Yorkie even Shih Tzu, so it just varies.</p>

        <p>We provide all potential adopters with notes on possible characteristics they may notice when their pet first arrives. Please keep in mind as you read the notes, that not all dogs have all of those behaviors, itâ€™s really dependent on their previous living situation (streets, house, shelter, etc.). </p>

        <p>Most Sapnish rescues don't have a lot, if any, interaction with cats. While they both share the streets, so to speak, cats are usually up hiding or walking on walls. We do have some dogs living with cats currently, and will state their compatibility on their adoption page. If you have any questions about a specific dog and other pets, please email us.</p>

        <p>Our most common mode of trasportation is by ground travel. Spanish rescues are driven from Spain to a "Pick-Up" point where you are able to pick-up your dog.</p>

        <p>Altough we don't have an adoption "fee", we do request a donation to reimburse us for vaccines, microchipping and transport. The donation we request is &euro; 310 per dog. This donation is collected when you sign and submit the adoption contract.</p>
